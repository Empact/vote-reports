Welcome to VoteReports
======================

This is my modest effort to inform the voting process, created with James Teow and others starting in November 2009.

It aims to be a generic system for politician report cards, to inform fact-based voting from the top of the ballot to the bottom.

You can find it here: http://votereports.org/

Unfortunately I don't have much time to devote to it at the moment, but important next steps include:
* Crowd-sourced ratings system for non-incumbent politicians
* A classification system for politicians, such that we can give them each a category (ala blue dog democrat, libertarian republican) to quickly communicate their general positions.

Thanks for looking, and remember: Knowing is half the ballot!
