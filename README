Welcome to VoteReports
======================

To inform. To promote truth. To combat political apathy.

Extract State class for associating terms and such
script/generate rspec_model BillRelation from_id:integer to_id:integer relation:string
Missing data model: related bills, actions, status
Bill subcommittee references often don't exist: e.g. Bill 106-s68 listed committee 'International Security, Proliferation and Federal Services' via <committee name="Senate Governmental Affairs" subcommittee="International Security, Proliferation and Federal Services" activity="Referral"/> which wasn't found
Constrain Roll#roll_type to not-blank (deal with: 103/rolls/h1994-68.xml)
BillType is dangerous in that you must call #to_s to get the expected view string
Push back sunspot retry logic to github: /opt/local/lib/ruby/gems/1.8/gems/rsolr-0.11.0/lib/rsolr/connection/net_http.rb:31:in `request'
/opt/local/lib/ruby/gems/1.8/gems/sunspot_rails-0.11.4/lib/sunspot/rails/searchable.rb:200:in `reindex'
Should use offset:
/opt/local/lib/ruby/gems/1.8/gems/sunspot_rails-0.11.4/lib/sunspot/rails/searchable.rb:200:in `reindex'
Add ability to report a report (for misuse)

<p>Good governance makes all the difference in our communities.</p>
<p>But too often, politicians promise one thing and quietly deliver another.</p>
