      <span id="sectiontext">Interest groups individually have their own criteria of evaluating a politician. This usually includes voting records, interviews, survey results, and sources of funding. We also import interest group ratings from <a href="http://votesmart.org/">Project VoteSmart</a>.</span>

      <span id="sectiontext">Since many interest groups and member generated reports overlap certain subjects, we combine them into Causes. In essence, itâ€™s a stance on an issue. Collecting many scores helps average the grade and avoid one or more groups from polarizing a politicians grade.</span>
