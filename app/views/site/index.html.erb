        <h2>Get a quick overview</h2>
        <p>We know how hard it is to make sense of what the candidates are <em>really</em> up to, so we set out to create an open system for grading politicians from every possible political perspective, based on their actual votes.  Each of our reports has scores for representatives based on their actual votes, or ratings from leading interest groups.</p>

        <p>We go one step farther, by grouping these reports into "<%= link_to 'Causes', causes_path %>", which help to give a full picture of an important political issue.  Cause scores are based on the scores for the reports that went into that cause, and causes are curated with your input, so please <%= mail_to 'causes@votereports.org', 'let us know' %> if you have something to add, or any comment for that matter.</p>
