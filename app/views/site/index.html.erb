<div class="section">
  <h2>Use VoteReports to see if your representatives truly represent you</h2>
  <p>How it works:</p>

  <ol>
    <li><%= link_to 'Find reports', reports_path %> on the issues important to you</li>
    <li>Tell us who represents you</li>
    <li>We'll tell you how well they represent you, really</li>
  </ol>

  <p>Our reports are created by people like you to condense all the complexity of politics to simple letter grades.  You can:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><%= link_to 'Find reports on the subjects you care about', reports_path %>. Use them to know how your rep is voting</li>
    <li><%= link_to 'Create a report', new_report_path %> to easily spread the word about who's voting right on the issues you care about</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Know how your representatives stand on <em>your</em> issues</p>
