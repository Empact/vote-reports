  As a user
  I want to browse cause scores

  Background:
    Given a cause named "Lollipops!"
    And a published report named "Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence"
    And a published report named "Aren't Circuses Great!?"

  Scenario: Viewing cause scores derived from associated reports
    Given the following in-office politician records:
      | name                  |
      | Piyush Jindal         |
      | Ron Wyden             |

      | politician    | score |
      | Piyush Jindal | 97    |

      | politician    | score |

    And cause "Lollipops!" includes report "Aren't Circuses Great!?"
