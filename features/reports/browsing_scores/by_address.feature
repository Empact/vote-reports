      | bill                        | support |
      | Bovine Security Act of 2009 | true    |

  Scenario: When unscoped, report scores should be proper and complete
    When I go to my report page for "Active Report"
    Then I should see the following scores:
      | politician           | score |
      | Piyush Jindal        | 100   |
      | J. Kerrey            | 24    |
      | Martin Sabo          | 76    |
      | Edward Kaufman       | 53    |
      | Connie Mack          | 50    |
      | Neil Abercrombie     | 0     |

  Scenario Outline: Narrow report results to those within a certain zip code
    When I go to my report page for "Active Report"
    And I fill in "From Where?" with "<location>"
    And I press "Go!"
    Then I should see the following scores:
      | politician           | score |
      | Piyush Jindal        | 100   |
      | Edward Kaufman       | 53    |
      | Martin Sabo          | 76    |
    But I should not see "J. Kerrey"
    And I should not see "Connie Mack"
    And I should not see "Neil Abercrombie"

  Examples:
    | location                         |
    | 1115 Oak Drive, Flower Mound, TX |
    | Flower Mound 75028               |
    | 1115 oak drive flower mound      |

      | politician           | score |
